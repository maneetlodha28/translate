# Translate Gibberish
This is an basic web application where I have used third part API(funtranslations.com) to translate english to minion(gibberish) language.
* Used fetch to send GET request to API.
* Added Toastify library to improve the design of notification window.
* Hosted on Netlify, here's a [link](https://translategibberish.netlify.app) to the app.
